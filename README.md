# vertx3-spock-example

Show use of spock to do async testing with vertx3

There's no gradle wrapper.  Known to work with gradle 2.7

The idea is to test vertx java or groovy code with Spock's async capability -- no need for the Vertx test package.  But this is a trivial example so far.

## todo

* Port more of the official Vertx test examples to spock.
* Show tests of both java and groovy code under test.
